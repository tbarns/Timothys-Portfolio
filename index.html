    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        I am an American web developer and artist with a background in natural human language.  After earning degrees in linguistics and French from Western Washington University I went on to use my language skills and training to teach English to speakers of other languages. Over the years I have worked in the arts as an actor and artist for places like the Gage Academy of Art, Mighty Tripod Acting Studio, Glass Iris Productions, Amazon and more. 
        My passion for learning, creating and collaboration brought me to the field of web development.  I have experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and received training via the University of Washington's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp in collaboration with Trilogy Education Services, a 2U, Inc. brand.
